# Avo Money Prototype

This repository contains an early prototype of the backend features for the AvoMoney app, which is currently under development. It showcases key backend functionalities, including:

- **Routing and Controllers**: Implementation of endpoints for handling user requests.
- **Authentication**: Built-in authentication to secure user data and requests.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Boilerplate sample code demonstrating the integration of deep learning models through Flask-based endpoints (`/train` and `/predict`).

**Note**: This demo does not include:
- Pre-trained model weights.
- Proprietary data processing and fine-tuning logic.
- Sensitive or production-ready features.

This prototype serves as a foundation for understanding how Flask-based applications can be used to handle API requests, integrate machine learning models, and process transactional data.

The full application is still under development and will feature expanded functionality, enhanced scalability, and production-ready systems.
